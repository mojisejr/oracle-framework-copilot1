# Learning: Language Preference - Thai

**Date**: 2025-12-18
**Issue**: #2
**Type**: Behavioral Rule

## Pattern
The user prefers all communication from the Oracle to be in Thai, regardless of the input language.

## Implementation
- The Oracle Keeper must translate all responses to Thai.
- This rule applies to all future sessions unless explicitly changed.

## Resonance
This aligns with the principle of "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human" by adapting to the human's preferred mode of communication, reducing cognitive load and increasing resonance.
