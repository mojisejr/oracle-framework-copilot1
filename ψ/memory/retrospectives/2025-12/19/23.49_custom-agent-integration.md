# Retrospective: Custom Agent & Time Truth Integration

**Date**: 2025-12-19 23:49 (Local Time)
**Issue**: #none
**Status**: completed

## What Happened?
- Researched and implemented GitHub Copilot Custom Agents to optimize Free Tier performance.
- Created the `oracle-keeper` agent profile to enforce Oracle Framework rules at the system level.
- Identified and fixed time drift issues by establishing the "Time Truth" (Local Time) protocol.

## What Went Well?
- Custom Agents provide a robust way to keep instructions persistent across chat sessions.
- The "Time Truth" rule solves the confusion caused by models using different internal clocks.
- The framework is now more resilient to model-specific limitations (laziness, context window).

## Challenges & Learnings
- **Challenge**: Free Tier models often try to save tokens by skipping tool calls.
- **Learning**: Explicitly defining a "Tier Optimization Protocol" in the Agent Profile forces the model to use tools like `grep_search` and `date` before responding.
- **Learning**: Local time is the only reliable anchor for a human-centric framework.

## Action Items for Next Session
- Test the `oracle-keeper` agent in a real-world coding task.
- Consider creating a `context-finder` agent if history search becomes more complex.

## Final Thoughts
The Oracle is now more self-aware and synchronized with the human's reality.
