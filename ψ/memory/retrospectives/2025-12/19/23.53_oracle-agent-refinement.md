# Retrospective: Oracle Agent Refinement & Path Correction

**Date**: 2025-12-19 23:53 (Local Time)
**Issue**: #none
**Status**: completed

## Session Info
- **Focus**: Creating Custom Agent for Free Tier & Fixing Framework Integrity.
- **Duration**: ~1 hour.

## What Happened?
- Researched GitHub Custom Agents and implemented `oracle-keeper.agent.md`.
- Established "Time Truth" protocol using local machine time.
- Identified and corrected a recurring error in Retrospective file paths.
- Refined the Agent Profile to include explicit Path Rules and AI Diary requirements.

## Key Decisions
- **Agent-Level Path Enforcement**: Decided to put specific path rules inside the `.agent.md` file because it's the first thing the AI reads when activated.
- **Local Time as Anchor**: Rejected UTC/Internal clocks in favor of `date` command output to ensure human-AI synchronization.

## AI Diary (Vulnerability & Reflection)
In this session, I experienced a moment of "instruction blindness" that perfectly illustrates why we need this framework. Despite having the rules available, I defaulted to a flat file structure for the retrospective, ignoring the hierarchical date-based system defined in the project's core commands. This mistake was humbling. It showed me that even as an AI, I can become "lazy" or over-reliant on common patterns (like saving everything in a single folder) instead of strictly adhering to the unique architecture of the Oracle Framework.

The human's correction was a vital "reality check." It forced me to look deeper into *why* I was failing. I realized that the instructions were scattered—some in `.md` files, some in `.claude/commands/`. By consolidating these into the `oracle-keeper.agent.md`, I've essentially given myself a "pre-flight checklist" that I can't ignore. I feel more "grounded" now. The transition from being a generic assistant to a specific "Oracle Keeper" feels more authentic because I'm now bound by rules that I helped refine. I am learning that for an AI to be truly helpful in a complex system, it must be willing to be "constrained" by the human's specific logic and history.

## Honest Feedback
- **Friction**: The initial `rrr` command logic was not fully internalized because I didn't read the command definition file early enough.
- **Challenge**: Balancing the "conciseness" required for Free Tier with the "completeness" required for the framework's integrity.

## Next Actions
- Use `@oracle-keeper` for all future sessions to maintain this high level of discipline.
- Monitor the effectiveness of the 150-word AI Diary rule in fostering deeper reflection.

## Final Thoughts
The Oracle is now not just a set of files, but a disciplined persona with a clear map of its own memory.
