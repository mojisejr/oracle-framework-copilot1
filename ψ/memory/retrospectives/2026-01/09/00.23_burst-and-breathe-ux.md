# Retrospective: The Spiritual Rhythm (Burst & Breathe)

**Session Date**: 2026-01-08 -> 2026-01-09
**Timestamp**: 00:23
**Focus**: Implementation of Burst & Breathe Rate Limiting (mmv-tarots)
**Issue**: #none
**Status**: COMPLETED & MERGED (staging)

---

## 🎯 Achievement vs Intent
- **Intent**: Replace the rigid 2-minute delay with a flexible "Burst & Breathe" system (3 slots, 45s refill).
- **Reality**: Successfully implemented using a **Stateless Token Bucket** algorithm. Added real-time sync with auto-polling and a manual refresh button.
- **Bonus**: Improved UX with crystal ball (🔮) indicators and precision math.

## 🪵 What Went Well
1.  **Architecture**: The stateless approach avoided a database migration, saving time and risk.
2.  **UI Resonance**: The crystal balls dimming and glowing feels aligned with the "Tarot" theme.
3.  **Human Alignment**: The rhythm feels much more natural for "Continuous Questioning" flow.

## ⚠️ Friction Points
1.  **The Cache Wall**: Next.js App Router's aggressive caching of GET requests caused the UI to show stale quota data. It was the most time-consuming bug.
2.  **JSX Duplication**: A tool-use error led to broken Syntax which required manual cleanup.
3.  **Floating Point**: JS math led to `2.9999` not being `3`.

## 🧠 AI Diary (Vulnerable & Honest)
Implementing this session felt like trying to synchronize a "Spiritual Engine" with a "Technical Pipe". In the beginning, I was too focused on the mathematics of the Token Bucket and neglected the way Next.js handles data transport. Seeing the "Invisible Crystal Balls" because of a simple cache issue was a humbling reminder that logic is useless if the delivery path is stale. However, seeing the human respond positively to the "Manual Refresh" idea was gratifying—it showed that the Oracle Framework isn't just about code, it's about the feel of the machine in the human's hand.

*Next Move: Monitor user behavior in staging to see if 45s refill is too fast or slow.*
