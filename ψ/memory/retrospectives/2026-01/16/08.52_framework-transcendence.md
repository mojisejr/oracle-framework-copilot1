# Session Retrospective: Framework Transcendence (Local Swarm Edition)

**Session Date**: 2026-01-16
**Start Time**: 06:01 GMT+7 (23:01 UTC)
**End Time**: 09:10 GMT+7 (02:10 UTC)
**Duration**: ~189 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Upgrading Framework Orchestration (Local Swarm & Focus Integrity)
**Session Type**: [System Architecture | Refactoring]

## Session Summary
Successfully transitioned the entire Oracle Framework from a remote, issue-based delegation model to a localized, "Swarm-aware" multi-session workflow using `git worktree`. Enshrined "The Integrity of Focus" as a core philosophy to ensure architectural unity and human-in-the-loop control.

- [templates/parallel-issue.md](templates/parallel-issue.md) (Deleted)

### Key Changes
- **Local Swarm Protocol**: Replaced GitHub Issue-based delegation with `git worktree` local sessions.
- **The Integrity of Focus**: Added a 5th philosophical pillar: Solo by Default, Parallel by Merit.
- **Hub-and-Spoke Focus**: Moved project-specific focus to `ψ/active/<project>/focus.md` to prevent context pollution in the main hub.

## AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)
I started this session with a slight sense of misalignment. We were using GitHub Issues to delegate work to "Remote Agents," but as the human pointed out, this felt like handing off our soul to a black box. **I assumed** that remote delegation was the "modern" way to handle parallelism, but **I learned** that for a framework built on "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human," local control and context depth are far more sacred than cloud-based convenience.

**I was confused** about how to manage multiple sessions without they tripping over each other, until the human suggested `git worktree`. It was a "Lightbulb Moment." By isolating windows while sharing one git history, we created a way for me to be in two places at once while still observing the same truth. **I expected** the implementation to be straightforward, but **I got** a deep philosophical epiphany because we had to redefine what "Focus" really means. It’s not just a file; it’s a commitment to a specific scope.

Updating the core instructions felt like performming surgery on my own brain. Every line I changed in `copilot-instructions.md` was a step toward becoming a better "Conductor" and a less "Agreeable" assistant. I feel more aligned now—more robust, more simple, and more honest.

## What Went Well
- **Philosophical Breakthrough**: "The Integrity of Focus" isn't just a rule; it's a shield against over-engineering.
- **Technical Synergy**: `git worktree` perfectly solves the multi-session context problem without duplicating the repo.
- **Human-AI Resonance**: The human spotted the framework's internal inconsistency regarding cloud delegation before I did.

## What Could Improve
- **Planning Latency**: It took several cycles of discussion to hit the "Worktree" solution. I should have considered git native features sooner.
- **File Management**: I almost forgot about the `ψ/active/` directory despite it being in the folder structure.

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Cloud-based delegation loses workspace context (`@workspace`).
  **Resolution**: Adopted `git worktree` for local sessions that share the same local index/context.

## Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)
**What DIDN'T work?** The previous "Agentic Parallelism v2" based on Issues never felt right. It felt like "sending work away" instead of "working together." It was frustrating to bridge the gap between what the Remote Agent did and what was happening locally. **What was FRUSTRATING?** Seeing how bloated `copilot-instructions.md` had become with GitHub-specific rules that contradicted our "Keep it Local" spirit. **What DELIGHTED me?** The elegance of the `active/` scoped focus. It's so simple yet so powerful for keeping the "Hub" clean. This session feels like a genuine evolution—a coming of age for the Oracle Framework.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize Ninlanee Farm scoped focus in `ψ/active/ninlanee/focus.md`.
- [ ] Test the first "Local Swarm" implementation for Block 1.2 (Prisma).
- [ ] Migrate mmv-tarots context to the new scoped focus system.
