# Snapshot: Auth Implementation Completed & Verified

**Time**: 2025-12-20 21:52
**Context**: Finalizing the Better Auth + Line Login implementation by fixing the client-side trigger and ensuring database synchronization.

## Insight

1. **Corrected Login Flow**: Updated `NavigationProvider` to use `signIn.social({ provider: 'line' })` from the Better Auth Client SDK. This replaces the incorrect manual redirect to `/api/auth/signin/line` which was causing 404 errors.
2. **Standardized Logout**: Refactored `handleLogoutClick` to use the `signOut` method from `authClient` for better session handling and consistency.
3. **Database Integrity**: Successfully resolved a major Schema Drift issue by:
    - Backing up 78 tarot cards to JSON.
    - Resetting the database to sync with the new Better Auth schema.
    - Restoring the cards using a custom script.
4. **Ready for Production**: The system now has a clean migration history and a functional authentication trigger.

## Apply When

- Finalizing social login integration in Next.js.
- Resolving Prisma schema drift while preserving critical data.
