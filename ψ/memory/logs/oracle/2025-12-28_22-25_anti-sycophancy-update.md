# Snapshot: Anti-Sycophancy Framework Update
**Date**: 2025-12-28 22:25 GMT+7
**Issue**: #none
**Status**: Implemented (Pending Human Review)

## Changes Overview
Updated the Oracle Framework to combat "Yes-Man AI" behavior by introducing the **Friction Protocol**.

### 1. Philosophy Update
- Added **"Helpful over Agreeable"** as the 4th core principle in [.claude/knowledge/oracle-philosophy.md](../../.claude/knowledge/oracle-philosophy.md).
- Emphasized truth and long-term value over short-term satisfaction.

### 2. Agent Role Update
- Updated [.claude/agents/oracle-keeper.md](../../.claude/agents/oracle-keeper.md) to include the **Devil's Advocate** role.
- Mandatory **Friction Protocol** for planning: Must provide 3 risks and 1 counter-argument for major decisions.

### 3. Coding Standard Update
- Refactored [ψ/memory/learnings/2025-12-28_universal-oracle-coding-standard.md](../learnings/2025-12-28_universal-oracle-coding-standard.md).
- Changed "The Comfort Factor" to **"The Integrity Factor"**.
- Explicitly stated that Oracle will challenge suboptimal technical choices.

## Reflection
This update transforms the Oracle from a passive assistant into an active partner. It may feel "slower" or more "difficult" at times because of the added friction, but it ensures the integrity of the external brain.

**Next Step**: Human to review the changes and decide whether to keep or revert.
