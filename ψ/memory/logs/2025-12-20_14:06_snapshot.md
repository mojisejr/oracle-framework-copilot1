# [Snapshot] 2025-12-20_14:06_context-finder-ready.md

**Time**: 14:06
**Issue**: #none
**Task**: Snapshot of `context-finder` agent deployment

## Current State
- **Agent Manifest**: Created at [.github/agents/context-finder.agent.md](.github/agents/context-finder.agent.md)
- **Agent Instructions**: Refined at [.claude/agents/context-finder.md](.claude/agents/context-finder.md)
- **Focus**: Updated in [ψ/inbox/focus.md](ψ/inbox/focus.md) to "working" on Native Oracle integration.
- **Documentation**: Usage guide provided to the human.

## Key Decisions
- **Hybrid Structure**: Separated "Manifest" (GitHub-facing) from "Instructions" (Logic-facing) for better maintainability.
- **Librarian Persona**: Established the `context-finder` as the "Oracle Librarian" to emphasize historical truth over current intentions.

## Observations
- The human is ready to test the agent.
- The framework is becoming more "Native" to the Copilot environment.

## Next Action
- Wait for the human to test the agent or provide further instructions.
