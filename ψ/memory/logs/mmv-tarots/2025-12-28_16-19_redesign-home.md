# Snapshot: mmv-tarots Home Page Redesign
**Timestamp**: 2025-12-28 16:19:21
**Issue**: #none

## Changes
- **Layout**: Refactored `app/page.tsx` for mobile-first experience.
  - Hidden top navigation on mobile.
  - Fixed input field above bottom navigation for better thumb reach.
  - Implemented full-screen height (`min-h-[100dvh]`).
- **Visuals**: Updated `app/globals.css` with "Sai Mu" theme variables and glassmorphism effects.
- **Avatar**: Completely redesigned `MimiAvatar` using Three.js.
  - Ported logic from `ai-orb.html`.
  - Implemented screen-wide particle spread ("ฟุ้ง").
  - Added Bloom post-processing for mystical glow.
  - Removed black background to integrate with app theme.

## Decisions
- Used `fixed inset-0` for `MimiAvatar` to act as a living background.
- Increased particle count and radius for "ฟุ้ง" effect as requested by user.
- Kept performance mode toggle for low-end devices.

## Status
- Build: Success
- Lint: Success
- Commit: `b82d084`
