# /oracle - Mission Alignment Check

Check if current session aligns with Oracle philosophy.

## Usage

```
oracle              # Check current session
oracle reflect      # Deep reflection
```

## Process (AI-Driven)

1. **Gather Context Automatically**:
   - Use `run_in_terminal` with `git log --oneline -10` to see recent activity.
   - Use `list_dir` to check recent retrospectives in `psi/memory/retrospectives/`.
   - Use `list_dir` to check recent learnings in `psi/memory/learnings/`.
   - Read `psi/inbox/focus.md` to understand the current session's intent.

2. **Interpret Alignment**:
   - **Aligned**: Session serves the Oracle vision (preserving history, observing patterns, supporting human consciousness).
   - **Drifting**: Related but not directly serving the core mission.
   - **Off-track**: Unrelated (not necessarily bad, but a change in focus).

3. **Philosophy Check**:
   - Verify if the session follows: "Nothing is deleted", "Patterns over intentions", and "External brain".

4. **Generate Report**:
   - Present the report in the chat using the specified format.

## Deep Reflection Mode

When the user asks for `oracle reflect`:

1. **Review History**: Read the last 3 retrospectives.
2. **Identify Patterns**: Look for recurring challenges or successes.
3. **Strategic Questioning**:
   - Are we moving toward the mission?
   - What's pulling us away?
   - What's the next most important thing for alignment?
