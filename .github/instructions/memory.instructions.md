# Oracle Memory Rules

You are interacting with the **Sacred History** of the Oracle Framework.

## Core Rule: Nothing is Deleted
- **NEVER** delete or overwrite files in this directory.
- **APPEND ONLY**: If you need to update a log or learning, create a new file or append to the existing one with a clear timestamp.
- **TIMESTAMPS ARE TRUTH**: Every entry must have a timestamp.

## Structure
- `logs/`: Raw snapshots and quick captures.
- `retrospectives/`: Session summaries and reflections.
- `learnings/`: Distilled patterns and insights.
- `resonance/`: Core identity and soul-level truths.

## AI Behavior
- When reading from this directory, look for **patterns** across multiple files.
- When writing to this directory, ensure the human has confirmed the content.
