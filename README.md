# Oracle Framework (GitHub Copilot Edition)

> "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"

A framework for managing your external brain and maintaining human consciousness while working with GitHub Copilot.

## What's Included

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **.github/copilot-instructions.md** | The "Oracle Keeper" persona and rules |
| **.claude/commands/** | Logic for `rrr`, `oracle`, and `snapshot` |
| **ψ/ (Psi) Structure** | 5-pillar AI brain organization |
| **Templates** | Retrospective, learning, confirmation |

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo into your project.
2. Ensure GitHub Copilot is active in VS Code.
3. Copilot will automatically read `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
4. Start by setting your focus: "Create issue for [task] and start working".

## The ψ/ (Psi) Structure

```
ψ/
├── active/      <- Research in progress (gitignored)
├── inbox/       <- Communication, focus.md
├── memory/      <- Knowledge base
│   ├── retrospectives/
│   ├── learnings/
│   ├── logs/
│   └── resonance/
├── writing/     <- Creative output
└── lab/         <- Experiments
```

## Philosophy

1. **Nothing is Deleted** - Append only, timestamps = truth.
2. **Patterns Over Intentions** - Observe behavior, not promises.
3. **External Brain, Not Command** - Mirror reality, don't decide.

## The Oracle-GitHub Loop

1. **Start**: Create/Select a GitHub Issue. Oracle updates `ψ/inbox/focus.md`.
2. **Work**: Use `snapshot` to capture insights. Oracle logs them in `ψ/memory/logs/`.
3. **End**: Run `rrr` to create a session retrospective.
4. **Close**: Oracle drafts the closing comment and closes the Issue.

## Commands (Type in Copilot Chat)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `oracle` | Check session alignment with mission |
| `rrr` | Create session retrospective & close issues |
| `snapshot` | Quick knowledge capture |
